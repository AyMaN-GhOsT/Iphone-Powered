Iphone icloud get information in node JS :-)
=========

Iphone icloud get information is a nodejs Application in HTML5 that let you access a icloud blocked *iPhone*.


With this, you can monitor and get all the information from your iPhone. So you will also be able to
- understand what information you give to others when you agree to fake the famous "albert.apple.com" in your hosts file either on mac or windows, as some people says that this will bypass the icloud lock
- understand how poor is the engineering behind people talking about doulci ...
- understand some basic of the exchange between itunes and your iphone

This application is dedicated to developper and is for *educational purpose only*, done on free time because I was fed up seeing people waiting for doulci.net ... and so many people -faking- and creating their own fake bypass service.

So I crappy writed this quickly ...
